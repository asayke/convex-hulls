# Convex::Hulls

The Jarvis algorithm (or the Jarvis bypass algorithm, or the gift wrapping algorithm) determines the sequence of elements of a set forming a convex hull for this set. The method can be represented as a rope wrapping of a set of nails driven into the board. The algorithm works in time O(nh), where n is the total number of points on the plane,  h is the number of points in the convex hull.

Graham's algorithm is an algorithm for constructing a convex hull in twoâ€”dimensional space. In this algorithm, the convex hull problem is solved using a stack formed from candidate points. All points of the input set are entered into the stack, and then points that are not vertices of the convex hull are eventually removed from it. Upon completion of the algorithm, only the shell vertices remain in the glass in the order of their counterclockwise traversal.

## Installation

TODO: Replace `UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_PRIOR_TO_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG` with your gem name right after releasing it to RubyGems.org. Please do not do it earlier due to security reasons. Alternatively, replace this section with instructions to install your gem from git if you don't plan to release to RubyGems.org.

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_PRIOR_TO_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_PRIOR_TO_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG

## Usage

To use Algorithms, you need to create an Algorithms class object and call its methods.

Jarvis algorithm :
```rb
@jarvis.jarvis(points)
```

Graham algorithm :
```rb
@graham.graham(points)
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
